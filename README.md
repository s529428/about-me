## About
This repository is for the Northwest Missouri State University Class: Developing Web Apps and Services to introduce Caroline Finnerty and to get to know what tools I like to use for web development. 

## Recommended Tools

In order to publish a page to git hub pages the following things are strongly recommended.
1. Access to a computer with a secure internet connection 
1. A github account with a long password
1. A repository with at least a README.md or a index.md and some content in those files.
1. The ability to go into the settings of said github repository and change the github pages settings and change the source to master branch. 

These things are the bare minimum, I would say, to publish a page with github pages. To take your github page to the next level, I would reccommend installing git or some git client on your machine and a text editor to get really fancy.

## Recommended Resources

Here are some resources I usually use on the daily when developing for web.
1. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
1. [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
1. [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

These are all good resources for answering any questions one may have during web development. If one is hoping to get a crash course, I recommend going to [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)
